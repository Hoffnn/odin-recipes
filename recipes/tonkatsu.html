    <p>Tonkatsu consists of tender pork loin (or fillet) that has been breaded and deep-fried to crunchy perfection.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork loin or fillet</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Panko</li>
        <li>Neutral flavored oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>Tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>(Optional)Sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Dredge the pork in the flour and dust off any excess</li>
        <li>Dip the pork into the egg mixture and coat well</li>
        <li>Dredge the pork in the fresh panko and shake off any excess. Set aside for 5-10 minutes</li>
        <li>Deep fry it for a minute, a piece once a time. After a minute, flip the pork. Tip: Drop one piece of panko into the oil; if it sinks down to the middle of the oil and immediately pops back up to the surface, then the oil is ready. </li>
        <li>Take it off from the oil and let it rest on paper towel for 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat to scoop fried crumbs. Turn the heat on again</li>
        <li>Fry again, 30 seconds each side, and let it rest on paper towel for two minutes.</li>
    </ol>
